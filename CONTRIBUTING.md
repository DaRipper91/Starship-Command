## Code Style & Standards

We enforce strict code quality rules using ESLint and Prettier.

- **No `any`**: TypeScript strict mode is enabled. Avoid `any` at all costs.
- **Imports**: Imports are automatically sorted. Run `npm run lint -- --fix` to sort them.
- **No Console Logs**: Production code should not contain `console.log`. Use `console.warn` or `console.error` sparingly.
- **Unused Variables**: Unused variables are not allowed. Prefix with `_` if they are intentional.

Before committing, please run:
- `npm run format` (to fix formatting)
- `npm run lint` (to check for violations)
- `npm run build` (to ensure type safety - uses `tsc -b`)

We use `husky` and `lint-staged` to automatically check your code on commit.
