## 🛠️ GEMINI CLI + JULES ORCHESTRATOR (The Termux Bridge)

**What it is:** A specialized integration for Termux/Android users that combines the local research power of **Gemini CLI** with the autonomous implementation power of **Jules**.

**Command:** `/jules [task description]` (Custom Gemini CLI command)

### How the Orchestrator Works

1.  **Phase 1: Scout (Gemini CLI)**
    - Run `/research` or `/plan` in Gemini CLI to map the problem space.
    - Gemini analyzes your local `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
2.  **Phase 2: Brief (The Bridge)**
    - Run `/jules "Your Task"`.
    - Gemini CLI generates a high-density `JULES-BRIEFING.md` file automatically.
    - This briefing contains all the architectural guardrails Jules needs to succeed.
3.  **Phase 3: Execute (Jules)**
    - The `starship-jules.sh` script detects the briefing and hands it off to Jules in the cloud.
    - Jules implements the changes and opens a Pull Request.

### Why Use the Orchestrator?

- **Zero Hallucination:** Jules gets the exact local project context (types, stores, components) via the Gemini-generated briefing.
- **Async Power:** You can continue working in Termux while Jules handles the 100+ line implementation in the cloud.
- **Mobile Optimized:** Designed to work within Termux constraints, handling networking and DNS automatically.

## 🟦 JULES — The Autonomous Builder

**What it is:** Google's asynchronous AI coding agent powered by Gemini 3 Pro.
It works fully autonomously — you hand it a task, it goes away, codes in a cloud
VM, runs tests, and comes back with a pull request. You don't have to watch it.

**Instructions file:** `AGENTS.md` in the root of your repository.

### What DaRipper and Gemini Can Do

| Capability                   | Details                                               |

### Tips for Writing Good DaRipper and Gemini Prompts

**Be specific and measurable:**

```
✅ GOOD:
"Add a ModuleConfigPanel component in src/components/ModuleConfigPanel/index.tsx
that accepts moduleName: string and config: ModuleConfig props.
Run npm run build to verify no TypeScript errors.
Run npm test to verify no regressions."

❌ BAD:
"Add module configuration"
```

**Include success criteria DaRipper and Gemini can verify:**

```
✅ GOOD:
"The component is complete when:
1. npm run build exits with code 0
2. npm test exits with code 0
3. The component renders without errors when moduleName='directory'
4. Changing a value in the form updates the store"

❌ BAD:
"Make sure it works"
```

**Reference AGENTS.md standards:**

```
✅ GOOD:
"Follow the coding standards in AGENTS.md:
- TypeScript types for all props
- Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles)
- useToast() for user feedback
- Loading states for async operations"
```

## ⬛ GITHUB COPILOT — The Interactive Collaborator

**What it is:** GitHub's AI coding assistant that works interactively in VS Code,
on GitHub.com, and as an autonomous coding agent for background tasks.

**Instructions file:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### The Three Ways Copilot Helps

#### 1. VS Code Chat & Inline Suggestions

Real-time help as you code:

- Type a comment → Copilot completes the code
- Ask a question in chat → Copilot explains
- Select code → Ask Copilot to refactor/fix/explain it
- Use `@workspace` → Copilot understands your whole project

#### 2. VS Code Agent Mode (Interactive)

For multi-step tasks while you're actively working:

```
1. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Alt+I)
2. Switch to "Agent" mode in dropdown
3. Type: "Create a color picker component with Nord preset support"
4. Copilot reads the workspace, proposes files to edit
5. Executes changes, runs terminal commands
6. Fixes any errors it encounters
7. You stay in control and can guide it
```

Best for:

- Complex refactors while watching progress
- Debugging sessions where you need to iterate fast
- Exploring how to implement something new
- When you want to see and guide each step

#### 3. Copilot Coding Agent (Background/Autonomous)

For delegated tasks that run in background without your attention:

```
Method A — Assign GitHub Issue:
  1. Create issue on GitHub.com
  2. Set Assignee → "Copilot"
  3. Copilot creates branch (copilot/issue-XX-...)
  4. Copilot opens draft PR with commits
  5. Copilot requests your review
  6. Leave PR comments → Copilot iterates
  7. Merge when satisfied

Method B — VS Code Delegate:
  1. Have a chat conversation about the task
  2. Click "Delegate to coding agent"
  3. Chat context automatically sent to agent
  4. Agent works in background
  5. PR created for review

Method C — @copilot mention in PR:
  Add comment to any PR:
  "@copilot Can you add error handling for the image upload?"
  Copilot will respond with code changes to the PR
```

### What Copilot Can Do

| Capability                  | Details                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inline code completion**  | Context-aware suggestions as you type                |
| **Chat Q&A**                | Answer questions about code, docs, architecture      |
| **Agent mode (VS Code)**    | Interactive multi-file edits with terminal           |
| **Coding agent (GitHub)**   | Autonomous background task → PR workflow             |
| **PR review**               | Automated code review with line-by-line comments     |
| **PR summaries**            | AI-generated summary of what a PR changes            |
| **Security scanning**       | Checks code it writes for vulnerabilities            |
| **@copilot in PR comments** | Ask Copilot to fix specific things in a PR           |
| **MCP integration**         | Connect to external tools via Model Context Protocol |
| **Multi-model support**     | GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini — switch models           |
| **Issue-to-PR workflow**    | Assign issue → Copilot implements → PR ready         |

### Copilot Scheduled/Automated Capabilities

Unlike DaRipper and Gemini, Copilot doesn't have a traditional cron scheduler, but you can
trigger it automatically through GitHub events:

```yaml
# Example: Auto-assign new "good first issue" bugs to Copilot
# .github/workflows/copilot-auto-assign.yml

name: Auto-Assign to Copilot
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  assign:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'copilot-fix'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.addAssignees({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              assignees: ['copilot']
            })
```

**Copilot Automation Triggers:**

```
On new issue labeled 'copilot-fix'    → Auto-assign to Copilot
On PR opened                          → Auto code review
On PR merged                          → Auto-summarize changes
On @copilot mention in PR comment     → Copilot responds with changes
On 'Delegate to agent' in VS Code     → Background implementation
```

### Copilot Workflow for This Project

**Daily Development Pattern:**

```
1. Open VS Code
2. Run: bash scripts/dev.sh
3. Use Copilot inline suggestions as you write code
4. For complex features: use Agent Mode in VS Code
5. For backlog tasks: assign to Copilot Coding Agent
6. Review Copilot's PRs on GitHub
```

**Issue Management Pattern:**

```
For SIMPLE bugs:
  → Assign to @copilot directly in GitHub issue
  → Copilot creates branch, fixes, opens PR
  → Review and merge

For COMPLEX features:
  → Use DaRipper and Gemini (better at large multi-file features)
  → Or delegate from VS Code Chat with full context

For QUICK fixes while in VS Code:
  → Use Agent Mode
  → Stay in VS Code, see changes in real time
```

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Write better DaRipper and Gemini prompts:**

- Always end with: "Run `npm run build && npm test` before creating the PR"
- Include file paths explicitly: "in src/components/ColorPicker/index.tsx"
- Give success criteria DaRipper and Gemini can test: "The component renders without errors"

**Get better Copilot suggestions:**

- Keep `.github/copilot-instructions.md` updated as the project evolves
- Use `@workspace` in chat for full codebase context
- Reference specific files with `#file:src/lib/color-utils.ts`

**Avoid conflicts between the two:**

- Don't have DaRipper and Gemini and Copilot working on the same file simultaneously
- DaRipper and Gemini owns scheduled automation — don't override with Copilot
- Use branch naming to signal who's working: `checkpoint/` = DaRipper and Gemini, `copilot/` = Copilot

**Monitor what they're doing:**

- DaRipper and Gemini: Check https://jules.google dashboard
- Copilot: Check draft PRs in your GitHub repo
- Both: Review the Actions tab in GitHub for workflow runs

## 🐟 FISH SHELL INTEGRATION: THE ORCHESTRATOR SUITE

For high-speed automation in Termux, use the following Fish functions.

### `scout [task]`

Runs the local Gemini CLI research phase. It analyzes the `AGENTS.md` and project context to generate a high-density `JULES-BRIEFING.md` file.

### `hammer`

The execution command. It invokes the `starship-jules.sh` script, which reads the `JULES-BRIEFING.md` and submits it to the Jules cloud agent.

### `sj [task]` (Scout + Hammer)

Combines the two into a single operation: `sj "Refactor the theme store"`.

### `jl` and `jp [id]`

- **`jl`**: List active Jules sessions.
- **`jp [id]`**: Pull and apply a patch from a session ID.

### `g2j [instruction]`

Pipes current `stdin` (file/diff) through Gemini for a quick-fix instruction, then submits it directly to Jules.
